/**
 * Stryker-only test config (see stryker.config.json). Stryker sandboxes just
 * `backend/` (the directory it's run from), not the whole repo — so tests
 * that read files outside backend/ via `path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "..")`
 * (sessionBuilder.test.ts, dataSchemaCompliance.test.ts both read
 * `../../data/*.json`) fail inside the sandbox with ENOENT, aborting
 * Stryker's dry run before mutation testing even starts. Mutation is scoped
 * to src/curation/scoring.ts and src/identity/dedup.ts only (stryker
 * "mutate" config) — those two files are already exercised directly by
 * test/scoring.test.ts, test/dedup.test.ts, and test/property/*.test.ts, so
 * excluding the two repo-root-dependent tests from the Stryker run doesn't
 * cost mutation coverage on the files actually being mutated. `npm test`
 * (the real gate) still runs the full suite via vitest.config.ts unchanged.
